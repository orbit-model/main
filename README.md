# orbit-model

This is the playground for creating a first version of a model based abstraction layer for the [orbit.js](http://orbitjs.com) data orchestration library.

## RFCs

For more details of what we want to create here, please read the related RFCs posted as issues 
on the [orbit.js monorepo](https://github.com/orbitjs/orbit):

## Contributing

This repository is a so called "monorepo", managed by `lerna` - don't worry, you won't need to know `lerna` to contribute, the scripts defined in the `package.json` should take care of everything for you.

This project requires `yarn`! Please do not use it with `npm`.

```bash
# installs everything for every project and links them
yarn install
